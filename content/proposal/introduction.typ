= Introduction
The Unified Modeling Language (UML) has become one of the most widely used standards for specifying and documenting information systems @uml-introduction. Developers use UML diagrams to visualize the structure or behavior of a system, playing a crucial role in software engineering workflows. Most importantly, UML diagrams help developers share a common understanding of the ongoing work @software-engineering. Such diagrams are therefore useful in issues, pull requests and documentation.

Apollon #footnote[https://github.com/ls1intum/Apollon] is a web-based UML editor, developed at TUM, that allows users to create, edit, and share UML diagrams. It is possible to integrate Apollon with other JavaScript applications, such as the interactive learning platform Artemis, but also used through the standalone version @interactive-learning.
